    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Emission Lines in Astronomy</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Emission lines</strong> are bright spectral features that appear at specific wavelengths when atoms or molecules emit photons as electrons transition from higher to lower energy levels. These lines stand out against the background continuum and provide a wealth of information about the physical and chemical properties of astronomical objects.
    </p>

    <h2>What Causes Emission Lines?</h2>
    <p>
        Emission lines arise when an atom, ion, or molecule becomes excited — usually by heating, collisions, or photoionization — and then de-excites by emitting light at discrete wavelengths. This process is common in:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>H II regions</strong> — clouds of ionized hydrogen around young stars</li>
            <li><strong>Planetary nebulae</strong> — shells of gas ejected from dying stars</li>
            <li><strong>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)</strong> — energetic cores of galaxies</li>
            <li><strong>Supernova remnants</strong> — expanding clouds of hot gas</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Types of Emission Lines</h2>
    <p>
        Emission lines are broadly classified based on their origin and appearance:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Permitted lines:</strong> Arise from allowed electron transitions; typically strong and prominent (e.g., Hydrogen Balmer lines).</li>
            <li><strong>Forbidden lines:</strong> Denoted by square brackets like [O III], these are emitted from transitions that are unlikely under laboratory conditions but occur in low-density astrophysical environments.</li>
            <li><strong>Semi-forbidden lines:</strong> Transitions that are intermediate in strength, often marked with a single bracket (e.g., C III]).</li>
            <li><strong>Recombination lines:</strong> Result from electrons recombining with ions, commonly seen in hydrogen and helium lines.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Information Gained from Emission Lines</h2>
    <p>
        Emission lines are powerful diagnostic tools. They allow astronomers to:
        <ul>
            <li>Determine the chemical composition of gas clouds</li>
            <li>Measure electron temperature and density</li>
            <li>Identify the ionization state of elements</li>
            <li>Estimate star formation rates in galaxies</li>
            <li>Analyze motion via Doppler shifts (redshift/blueshift)</li>
            <li>Distinguish between different types of active galaxies</li>
        </ul>


    <h2>Most Common Emission Lines in Astronomy</h2>
    <p>
        Below are some of the most frequently observed emission lines in astronomical spectra:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lyα (1216 Å):</strong> The strongest hydrogen line in the ultraviolet, key for studying the early universe and high-redshift galaxies.</li>
            <li><strong>N V (1240): </strong>A weak line in the AGN</li>
            <li><strong>Si IV (1393 Å, 1402 Å)</strong> – Traces highly ionized gas in AGNs and star-forming galaxies</li>
            <li><strong>C IV (1548 Å, 1550 Å)</strong> – Prominent in quasars and AGN winds; indicates high-ionization states</li>
            <li><strong>He II (1640 Å)</strong> – Seen in hot stars and AGNs; useful for tracing extreme UV radiation</li>
            <li><strong>O III] (1660 Å, 1666 Å)</strong> – Found in star-forming regions and AGNs</li>
            <li><strong>N III] (1750 Å)</strong> – Seen in young, hot stellar populations and starbursts</li>
            <li><strong>Si III] (1883 Å, 1892 Å)</strong> – Useful for temperature and density diagnostics</li>
            <li><strong>C III] (1907 Å, 1909 Å)</strong> – Strong in compact star-forming galaxies and high-redshift sources</li>
            <li><strong>Mg II (2796 Å and 2803 Å):</strong> Often used in studies of AGN and quasar outflows in UV spectra.</li>
            <li><strong>[O II] (3727 Å):</strong> Common in star-forming galaxies; sensitive to metallicity.</li>
            <li><strong>[O II] (3727 Å):</strong> Common in star-forming galaxies; sensitive to metallicity.</li>
            <li><strong>[Ne III] (3869 Å):</strong> Seen in high-ionization regions like AGNs.</li>
            <li><strong>He II (4686 Å):</strong> Indicates high-energy ionizing sources; present in Wolf-Rayet stars and quasars.</li>
            <li><strong>[O III] (4959 Å and 5007 Å):</strong> Prominent in planetary nebulae and AGNs; strong indicator of ionized oxygen.</li>
            <li><strong>[N II] (6548 Å and 6583 Å):</strong> Emitted from low-excitation gas, important for distinguishing galaxy types.</li>
            <li><strong>[S II] (6716 Å and 6731 Å):</strong> Used to measure electron density; strong in supernova remnants and AGNs.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydrogen Balmer Series:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hα (6563 Å)</strong> – Strong line seen in star-forming regions and AGNs</li>
                <li><strong>Hβ (4861 Å)</strong> – Used in line ratio diagnostics like the BPT diagram</li>
            </ul>
        </li>     
      </ul>
    <h2>Applications in Galaxy Classification</h2>
    <p>
        Emission line ratios are used to classify galaxies and identify their dominant ionizing sources. One popular method is the <strong>BPT diagram</strong> (Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich), which plots [O III]/Hβ versus [N II]/Hα. This allows astronomers to distinguish between:
        <ul>
            <li>Star-forming galaxies</li>
            <li>Seyfert galaxies (AGN)</li>
            <li>LINERs (Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions)</li>
            <li>Composite galaxies (both star formation and AGN activity)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Emission lines are found across the electromagnetic spectrum:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ultraviolet (UV):</strong> Lyα, C IV, He II, Mg II – common in quasars and early galaxies</li>
            <li><strong>Optical:</strong> Hα, Hβ, [O III], [N II], [S II] – accessible from ground-based telescopes</li>
            <li><strong>Infrared (IR):</strong> Paschen and Brackett hydrogen lines, [Fe II], H<sub>2</sub> – used to study dust-obscured regions</li>
            <li><strong>X-ray:</strong> Highly ionized Fe, O, Ne lines – found in X-ray binaries and AGNs</li>
        </ul>
