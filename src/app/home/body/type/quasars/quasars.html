        <h1>Quasars (Quasi-Stellar Objects):</h1>
        <p>Quasars are the most luminous type of AGN and can outshine their host galaxies. They were first discovered as point-like sources (hence "quasi-stellar") 
        that emitted strong radio waves and showed redshifts indicating great distances. Their immense brightness comes from accretion of matter onto the central 
        supermassive black hole. Quasars are essentially distant AGNs, often found at the centers of young galaxies. Quasars, short for “quasi-stellar radio 
        sources,” are among the most energetic and luminous objects in the universe. They are a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN), powered by accretion of 
        matter into supermassive black holes at the centers of distant galaxies. Quasars were first discovered in the 1950s and 60s as strong radio sources with 
        stellar-like appearances, hence the name. However, unlike stars, they exhibit extremely high redshifts, indicating they are located billions of light-years 
        away. Despite this, their brightness is so immense that they can outshine entire galaxies, making them visible across the observable universe.

                <b>Discovery and Name:</b>
                <br>
                Quasars were initially identified as radio sources with optical counterparts that looked like stars but had unusual spectral lines. The first 
                recognized quasar, 3C 273, was identified by Maarten Schmidt in 1963, who showed that its spectrum had high redshifted hydrogen lines. This marked a 
                major breakthrough in extragalactic astronomy and established quasars as cosmological objects, not local stars.

                <b>Energy Source: </b>
                <br>
                The incredible energy output of quasars is powered by the accretion of gas and dust onto a supermassive black hole (usually more than a billion 
                times the mass of the Sun). As matter spirals inward toward the black hole, it forms an accretion disk that heats up due to friction and 
                gravitational compression. This process releases radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum from radio and infrared to optical, 
                ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Quasars can emit energy equivalent to trillions of Suns, concentrated in a region no larger than our Solar System.

                <b>Host Galaxies:</b>
                <br>
                Though quasars appear star-like in optical images, they are located at the centers of distant galaxies. These host galaxies are often elliptical or 
                merging systems, undergoing intense star formation or galaxy interactions. Because quasars are so bright, their host galaxies are often overwhelmed 
                in optical observations, but advanced instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes have imaged their galactic 
                surroundings.

                <b>Redshift and Distance: </b>
                <br>
                One of the defining properties of quasars is their high redshift, which indicates how much the universe has expanded since their light was emitted. 
                Quasars are among the most distant objects known, with redshifts exceeding z > 7, meaning we see them as they were less than a billion years after 
                the Big Bang. Their study provides a glimpse into the early universe, revealing how galaxies and black holes evolved in the cosmic dawn.

                <b>Brightness and Variability:</b>
                <br>
                Quasars are extremely luminous, often 100 to 1000 times brighter than the Milky Way. They are also known for their variability, showing changes in 
                brightness on timescales ranging from hours to years. This variability suggests a very compact emission region again supporting the theory of a 
                central black hole engine.

        <b>Types of Quasars</b>
        <br>
        Though the term “quasar” originally referred to radio-loud, point-like sources, today it broadly includes different types of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) 
        with active nuclei. Based on different observational properties, quasars can be classified as follows:
        <br><br>
        <b>1. Radio-Loud vs. Radio-Quiet Quasars:</b>
        <br>
        Quasars are divided into radio-loud and radio-quiet categories based on the strength of their radio emission. Radio-loud quasars make up about 10% of the 
        quasar population and often have large-scale radio jets that extend beyond their host galaxy. These jets are believed to be powered by magnetic fields 
        twisted by the rotating black hole. Radio-quiet quasars, though lacking prominent jets, are still luminous at optical, UV, and X-ray wavelengths.
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Type 1 and Type 2 Quasars:</b>
        <br>
        In analogy to Seyfert galaxies, quasars are sometimes classified as Type 1 or Type 2 depending on the visibility of their broad emission lines. Type 1 
        quasars show both broad and narrow lines, indicating an unobstructed view of the inner accretion disk and broad-line region. Type 2 quasars show only narrow 
        lines, meaning that the broad-line region is obscured, likely by a dusty torus aligned edge-on to our line of sight. This classification supports the AGN 
        unification model.
        <br><br>
        <b>3. BAL Quasars (Broad Absorption Line Quasars):</b>
        <br>
        Some quasars exhibit broad absorption lines in their spectra, caused by fast outflows of gas moving away from the quasar at thousands of km/s. These are 
        known as BAL quasars and provide evidence of quasar-driven winds and feedback mechanisms that can influence star formation in the host galaxy.
