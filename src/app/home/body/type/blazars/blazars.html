        <h1>Blazars</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Blazars</strong> are one of the most extreme and energetic types of active galactic nuclei (AGN). They belong to a broader class of galaxies known as radio-loud AGN and are characterized by their rapid variability, intense radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, and powerful relativistic jets pointed almost directly toward Earth. Because of this alignment, their radiation is strongly beamed due to relativistic effects, making them appear far brighter and more variable than other AGN types. Blazars are among the brightest and most dynamic objects in the universe.

        <h2>What Is a Blazar?</h2>
        <p>
            A blazar is essentially a type of galaxy with a supermassive black hole at its center that is actively accreting matter and producing jets of high-energy particles. What makes a blazar special is its orientation: one of its jets is aimed nearly directly at us. This causes the jetâ€™s emission to be amplified through a process called <strong>relativistic beaming</strong>, making blazars appear unusually bright and variable. As a result, they are important laboratories for studying jet physics, black hole environments, and extreme high-energy processes in the universe.

        <h2>Structure of a Blazar</h2>
        <p>
            Like other AGNs, blazars consist of:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Central supermassive black hole</strong> (millions to billions of solar masses)</li>
                <li><strong>Accretion disk</strong> of infalling matter emitting strong optical and UV radiation</li>
                <li><strong>Relativistic jets</strong> of charged particles ejected at nearly the speed of light</li>
                <li><strong>Dusty torus</strong> surrounding the inner region</li>
                <li><strong>Broad- and narrow-line regions</strong> of ionized gas</li>
            </ul>
            In blazars, the jet dominates the observed radiation due to its orientation toward the observer.
            <h2>Types of Blazars</h2>
            <p>
            Blazars are generally classified into two main types based on their optical spectra:
            <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>BL Lacertae Objects (BL Lacs)</strong>: These show very weak or no emission lines in their spectra. Their emission is dominated by the jet, and they exhibit high variability and polarization.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs)</strong>: These have strong and broad emission lines, similar to quasars. They are generally more luminous than BL Lacs and show strong radio and gamma-ray emission.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Key Characteristics of Blazars</h2>
            <p>
                Blazars display several unique features that distinguish them from other galaxies and AGNs:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relativistic jets:</strong> Jets pointed close to the line of sight, causing relativistic beaming</li>
                <li><strong>Extreme variability:</strong> Rapid changes in brightness within hours or even minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Broadband emission:</strong> Radiation across the entire electromagnetic spectrum (radio to gamma rays)</li>
                <li><strong>High polarization:</strong> Light from blazars is often highly polarized, especially in the radio and optical bands</li>
                <li><strong>Strong gamma-ray emission:</strong> Many blazars are detected by space telescopes like Fermi due to intense gamma rays</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Blazar Emission Mechanisms</h2>
            <p>
                The radiation from blazars is largely non-thermal and is produced by processes such as:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Synchrotron radiation:</strong> Emission from relativistic electrons spiraling in magnetic fields (dominates radio to optical/UV)</li>
                <li><strong>Inverse Compton scattering:</strong> High-energy photons produced when electrons scatter lower-energy photons (responsible for X-rays and gamma rays)</li>
            </ul>
            These two processes create a characteristic "double-hump" shape in blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs).
            <h2>Examples of Notable Blazars</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BL Lacertae:</strong> The prototype of BL Lac objects, located in the constellation Lacerta</li>
                <li><strong>3C 279:</strong> A well-known FSRQ and one of the first blazars detected in gamma rays</li>
                <li><strong>PKS 2155-304:</strong> A bright BL Lac object frequently studied in X-ray and gamma-ray bands</li>
            </ul>
