         <h1>LINERs (Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions)</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>LINERs</strong>, or <em>Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions</em>, are a specific type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) found in the central regions of many galaxies. They are characterized by their optical emission-line spectra, which show relatively strong lines from weakly ionized or neutral atoms such as O I, N II, and S II. Compared to other AGN like Seyfert galaxies or quasars, LINERs have lower ionization energy lines and are typically much less luminous. They are commonly found in elliptical galaxies and bulges of spirals and are thought to represent a low-luminosity AGN phase.
        </p>
        <h2>What Defines a LINER?</h2>
        <p>
            LINERs are defined based on the ratios of specific optical emission lines. In particular, they show enhanced low-ionization lines relative to high-ionization lines. These spectral signatures are interpreted as arising from gas that is excited either by:
            <ul>
                <li>Photoionization from a central AGN (like a low-luminosity Seyfert nucleus), or</li>
                <li>Shocks and turbulence in the interstellar medium, or</li>
                <li>Hot evolved stars such as post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) stars</li>
            </ul>
            The exact energy source powering LINER emission can vary, making their classification and physical interpretation a topic of ongoing research.

        <h2>Emission Line Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            LINERs are distinguished by specific line ratios in their optical spectra. Their key features include:
            <ul>
                <li>Strong [O I] λ6300, [N II] λ6584, and [S II] λ6717, 6731 lines</li>
                <li>Relatively weak [O III] λ5007 compared to Seyfert galaxies</li>
                <li>Low ionization parameters and lower electron temperatures</li>
            </ul>
            These line ratios are used in diagnostic diagrams (such as BPT diagrams) to separate LINERs from other types of AGN and star-forming regions.

        <h2>Types of LINERs</h2>
        <p>
            Based on observational characteristics and physical mechanisms, LINERs can be further divided into:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AGN-powered LINERs:</strong> Where a weakly accreting supermassive black hole produces the ionizing radiation.</li>
                <li><strong>“Retired” galaxies:</strong> Where hot, old stars (like post-AGB stars) ionize the surrounding gas, mimicking AGN features.</li>
                <li><strong>Shock-powered LINERs:</strong> Where fast-moving gas shocks (from supernovae or galactic winds) heat and ionize the gas.</li>
            </ul>
            These variations suggest that LINER-like emission can arise from multiple physical sources, not only AGN.

        <h2>Host Galaxies</h2>
        <p>
            LINERs are most commonly found in:
            <ul>
                <li>Massive elliptical galaxies</li>
                <li>Lenticular galaxies (S0)</li>
                <li>Bulge-dominated spiral galaxies</li>
            </ul>
            They are especially common in the centers of early-type galaxies and are often associated with older stellar populations and little ongoing star formation.
        <h2>How Are LINERs Detected?</h2>
        <p>
            LINERs are primarily identified through optical spectroscopy. Key tools include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BPT (Baldwin, Phillips & Terlevich) diagrams</strong> that plot emission-line ratios like [O III]/Hβ vs [N II]/Hα</li>
                <li><strong>Integral field spectroscopy (IFS)</strong> to map emission regions across galaxy centers</li>
                <li><strong>Multi-wavelength observations</strong> (e.g., radio, X-ray) to distinguish between AGN and stellar processes</li>
            </ul>
            Because LINERs are faint, high-quality spectroscopy is essential for accurate classification.

                <li><strong>NGC 1052:</strong> A classic elliptical galaxy exhibiting strong LINER-type emission and jets.</li>
                <li><strong>NGC 5005:</strong> A spiral galaxy with LINER activity in its central region.</li>
