        <h1>Radio Galaxies</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>Radio galaxies</strong> are a special class of active galaxies that emit intense radiation in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These galaxies are powered by <strong>supermassive black holes</strong> at their centers, which actively accrete matter and produce relativistic jets that extend far beyond the galaxy itself. These jets accelerate charged particles to near light-speed, causing them to emit strong <em>synchrotron radiation</em>, particularly at radio wavelengths. Radio galaxies can have radio structures that span <strong>hundreds of thousands to millions of light-years</strong>, making them some of the largest single objects in the universe.

        <h2>Discovery and Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
            Radio galaxies were first discovered in the 1940s and 1950s with the advent of radio astronomy. Although they may look like ordinary elliptical galaxies in optical images, they are among the most energetic sources in the sky at radio frequencies. These galaxies emit jets of charged particles that form massive lobes, which are visible as two bright radio sources on either side of the host galaxy. These lobes are created when the jets interact with the intergalactic medium and are often observed in <strong>radio maps</strong> as symmetric structures.

        <h2>Structure of a Radio Galaxy</h2>
        <p>
            The typical structure of a radio galaxy includes:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Central supermassive black hole</strong>: The engine driving the activity, located at the galaxy's core.</li>
            <li><strong>Accretion disk</strong>: A rotating disk of gas and dust falling into the black hole.</li>
            <li><strong>Relativistic jets</strong>: Narrow beams of particles ejected perpendicular to the disk at nearly the speed of light.</li>
            <li><strong>Radio lobes</strong>: Large, balloon-like regions where jets terminate, emitting strong radio waves.</li>
            <li><strong>Hotspots</strong>: Bright regions at the edges of the lobes where jet material impacts intergalactic gas.</li>
            </ul>
      

        <h2>Types of Radio Galaxies</h2>
        <p>
            Based on their radio morphology, radio galaxies are broadly classified into two main types:
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR I)</strong>: These radio galaxies show jets that fade and become diffuse as they move away from the core. The radio emission is strongest near the center. FR I galaxies are generally less powerful and found in richer galaxy clusters.</li>
            <li><strong>Fanaroff-Riley Type II (FR II)</strong>: These galaxies exhibit strong, collimated jets that end in bright hotspots far from the galactic center. They are more powerful than FR I types and often show large, well-defined lobes with strong emission at their edges.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Examples of Radio Galaxies</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Cygnus A</strong>: One of the most powerful radio galaxies in the nearby universe, located about 600 million light-years away.</li>
            <li><strong>Centaurus A</strong>: A nearby radio galaxy with a prominent dust lane and strong radio jets, located only 12 million light-years away.</li>
            <li><strong>Hercules A</strong>: A massive elliptical galaxy with enormous radio lobes that extend far beyond the optical galaxy.</li>
            </ul>
