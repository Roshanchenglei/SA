        <h1>Seyfert Galaxies:</h1>
        Seyfert galaxies are one of the two largest groups of active galactic nuclei (AGN), the other being quasars. They are named 
        after American astronomer Carl K. Seyfert, who first identified these galaxies in 1943 as a class of galaxies with very bright nuclei and emission 
        lines in their spectra. Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies in visible light, but their cores are extremely luminous, often outshining
        the combined light of the stars in the rest of the galaxy. This luminosity is not due to stars but is produced by material falling into a supermassive 
        black hole at the galaxy’s center, releasing enormous amounts of energy.

            <li><b>Nature and Structure:</b>
            Seyfert galaxies host an active nucleus at their center, where a supermassive black hole (millions to billions of times the Sun's mass) accretes matter 
            from its surroundings. This accretion disk gets heated due to intense gravitational energy, producing radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum – 
            from radio waves to gamma rays. Surrounding the black hole is the broad-line region (BLR) of fast-moving gas clouds, and farther out, the narrow-line 
            region (NLR) composed of slower-moving gas. This structure is shrouded by a dusty torus that affects how the AGN is viewed from Earth.

            <li><b>Spectral Characteristics: </b>
            The defining feature of Seyfert galaxies is their emission line spectra. These spectra show strong lines of ionized gas – particularly hydrogen, helium, 
            oxygen, and nitrogen. These emission lines appear either broadened due to Doppler effects (caused by fast-moving gas) or narrow, depending on the region 
            of origin. The two different types of line widths are used to classify Seyfert galaxies into two types: Type I and Type II.

        <b>Types of Seyfert Galaxies</b>
        <br>
        Seyfert galaxies are broadly divided into two main types based on their spectral line features and the orientation of the central AGN to our line of sight. 
        The classification is as follows:
        <br><br>
        <b>1. Seyfert Type I Galaxies:</b>
        Seyfert Type I galaxies show both broad and narrow emission lines in their spectra. The broad lines originate from the broad-line region, which is close to 
        the central black hole and composed of gas clouds moving at velocities up to several thousand km/s. These broad lines typically include hydrogen Balmer 
        lines (e.g., H-alpha and H-beta) and other permitted transitions. In contrast, the narrow lines, emitted from farther out, include forbidden transitions 
        like [O III], [N II], and others. The visibility of broad lines suggests that we have an almost direct view of the BLR, meaning that the dusty torus is 
        oriented in a way that does not block our line of sight to the nucleus. Type I Seyferts often exhibit strong ultraviolet and X-ray emission due to the 
        unobscured central engine.
        <br><br>
        <b>2. Seyfert Type II Galaxies:</b>
        Seyfert Type II galaxies, on the other hand, show only narrow emission lines in their spectra. The broad-line region is either obscured or not visible due 
        to the orientation of the galaxy's dusty torus relative to our viewpoint. We are looking at the AGN from a more edge-on perspective, meaning the torus 
        blocks our view of the inner regions. As a result, the broad components of emission lines are hidden from our direct observation. Type II Seyferts still 
        display strong narrow lines, especially from ionized oxygen ([O III] λ5007), but their ultraviolet and X-ray outputs appear weaker due to absorption and 
        obscuration.
        <br><br>
        <b>Intermediate and Sub-types</b>
        <br>
        In some cases, galaxies display properties intermediate between Type I and Type II Seyferts. These are classified as Type 1.2, 1.5, 1.8, or 1.9, depending 
        on the relative strengths and visibility of their broad and narrow lines. For example, a Type 1.5 Seyfert shows both strong broad and narrow lines, but the 
        broad lines are weaker than in pure Type I. A Type 1.9 Seyfert might show broad H-alpha but no broad H-beta, indicating partial obscuration. 
        These intermediate types support the unified model of AGN, which proposes that the difference between Seyfert types is mainly due to orientation and 
        obscuration, rather than intrinsic differences in the AGN themselves.
