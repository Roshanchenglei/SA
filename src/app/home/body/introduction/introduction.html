        <u><h1>Introduction:</h1></u><br>
        Our universe consists of countless galaxies, and within each galaxy, there are millions to trillions of stars. Some of the stars may even have planetary systems 
        like our solar system. Classification of galaxies is done base on their appearance as spiral, barred spirals, and elliptical galaxies. But for astronomers, in 
        the beginning, this classification was only a step towards a deeper understanding, a key to galactic structure and evolution. The longer we study to them, they 
        turn out to galactic structure and evolution. The longer we study them, they turn out to be mysterious objects containing answers to profoundly critical 
        cosmological questions. The Milky Way galaxy appears as a faint white path band or like a flowing river at night and is estimated to contain approximately 
        10<sup>11</sup> stars, among other gaseous and dust contain. Hubble (1925,1926), first attempted understanding the observable universe. Consequently, Edward Hubble showed 
        that the galaxies were moving apart from each other proportional to the distance between them (Hubble, 1929, Sandage, 1999), known as Hubble’s Law.
        With technological advancements, better and precise observation at techniques both from on-the-ground and space, the observations have helped us increase the 
        horizon of the size’s observable universe. One more substantial and decisive step in this area was developing and deploying astronomical satellites into space. 
        This opened up other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that was not favorable for observation from ground-based telescopes due to attenuation by the 
        earth’s atmosphere.

        <u><b>Active Galactic Nuclei:</b></u>
        <br>
        Active galaxies were first mentioned in astronomical history in the 1950s, with the radio frequency’s first detection. In 1060’s these observations were 
        published as a catalogue under the title of “Third Cambridge Catalogue” or “3C catalogue” (Bennett, 1962). Active galaxies appear as star-like sources but 
        partly show non-thermal spectra. This concentrated non-thermal spectral emission actually comes from the center of the galaxy. Hence the name “Active Galactic
         Nuclei” (AGN). The observations of “active galaxies”/ AGN in the Ultraviolet (UV) region began with the launch of International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) in 
         1978. As AGNs were discovered, it became known that these were among the brightest sources in the universe with their bolometric immensities 
         ≈10<sup>40</sup>-10<sup>48</sup> erg/sec 
         and were extremely luminous over the entire electromagnetic wavelength.
        The first spectroscopic observations of quasars showed extremely broad emission lines at optical wavelengths, at which there were no known atomic emission lines 
        (Mathews and Sandage, 1963). Repeated observations of AGNs in different electromagnetic windows soon give rise to the understanding that these were atomic lines 
        but were redshifted from their rest wavelength. A well-known AGN from “3C catalogue”, 3C 273 was first studied, and its redshift was determined to 0.1589 by 
        Schmidt and Green, in the year 1963.

        <u><b>History and Discovery:</b></u>
        <br>
        Edward Arthur Fath gave the first-ever recorded evidence for AGNs’ existence through the spectrum of NGC 1068 from Lick Observatory (Fath, 1909). In 1943, Carl 
        Seyfert presented the analysis on the spectra of NGC 1068 (Seyfert, 1943), and henceforth similar objects were called a Seyfert Galaxies”. Three decades after 
        the first explanation provided by Seyfert, studies such
        luminous objects’ observations were intensified. They were also observed to have broad emission lines with having doppler broadening ∼ 1000 km/s to 10,000 km/s 
        and emission lines along with the variable UV to optical continuum in the spectra of active galaxies. (Weedman, 1977).
        Along with the optical observations, radio observations of these luminous objects revealed jet-like / filament structure/ extended objects unseen in the optical 
        UV region. These were termed as “Quasi Stellar Radio Sources” or in short “QUASAR”. With time and repeated observations, it became evident that a compact, 
        powerful energy source is present at the center of all these luminous galaxies. Collectively these powerful radio galaxies, quasars, and Seyfert galaxies have 
        been now referred to as “Active galaxies”. Active galaxies alternatively have been subdivided into two categories: (1) “Type 1” which had both permitted and 
        forbidden lines that were very broad than the forbidden lines that were very broad than the forbidden emission lines with typical line widths 35,000 km/sec and 
        (2) “Type 2” where the forbidden and permitted emission line had smaller widths ∼ 500 km/sec (Khachikyan and Weedman, 1971; Weedman, 1970).

        <u><b>Structure of AGNs:</b></u>
        <br>
        Active galaxies have been observed in different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and can be classified into several types. Some characteristics features 
        which have been seen are:
        <ul>
            <li>
            Point like sources: These are point-like as the AGN center is not resolvable with the existing ground and space-based telescopes.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Broad range of continuum: It is seen that many AGNs emit over a broad range of the electromagnetic spectrum from the optical to X-ray and sometimes in 
                γ-ray also. The optical and soft X-ray emission is seen in all active galaxies, but on the other hand the hard X-ray and γ emission is limited to only a 
                few AGNs. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Luminosity: The luminosity of AGNs span a range from 10<sup>42</sup> to 10<sup>48</sup> erg/s (Edilson et al., 1996).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Line Emission: The significant observation observed spectral feature of the AGNs is the broad and narrow line emissions. In some active galaxies 
                like NGC 5548, NGC 4151. Absorption lines are seen within strong emission lines. A line is described as broad if its Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) 
                is greater than 1,000km/s, and sometimes the observed FWHM is of the order ∼10,000 km/s (Boroson and Green, 1992). A most important and noticeable 
                feature in the spectra is a blue bump near 5000 Å (Netzer, 1985). Narrow lines are found in all AGNs and also in starburst galaxies. Emission 
                lines are used are used as a diagnostic tool in distinguishing normal galaxies from ANGs (Baldwin et al., 1981; Veilleus and Osterbrock, 1987).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Variability: This is a strong observation feature observed in almost all AGNs over a long period of time (Koo et al., 1986). The variability time 
                scales can be of the order of decades in some objects (de Vries et al., 2005) Ulrich et al., 1997a) to a few days (Vedavathi and Doddamani, 2018) 
                to the order of few hours in others (Wagner and Witzel, 1995). The phenomenon of variability was observed in radio by (Ulrich et al., 1997a), in 
                optical by Koo et al., 1986. In UV by Vedavathi and Doddamani (2018) and X-rays (Vaughan et al., 2003) in active galaxies like Mrk 841, NGC 5548,
                 3C 273, NGC 4151, NGC 7469.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        A broader and better picture of AGNs may be obtained only by simultaneous observations in different wavelength regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
        The current and most accepted model of the structure of the AGNs is shown Fig 1.1. Antonucci (1993) and Urry et al (1995) have proposed the “unified model 
        of AGN” which explains the different observational classed and the various properties exhibited by AGNs. These models consist of an accretion disk 
        surrounding the central Super Massive Black Hole (SMBH) with their mass in the range ∼10<sup>8</sup> - 10<sup>9</sup> M<sub>ʘ</sub> residing inside a dusty 
        torus. Stars moving too close to this SMBH are pulled inward due radiates significantly in the optical, UV, and soft X-ray wavebands and is surrounded by 
        Broad Line Regions (BLR) and Narrow Line Regions (NLR). BLR is present a distance of ∼ 1 Light year (Ly) from the central SMBH with gas moving with gas 
        moving at velocities of ≈ 1,000 km/s. The incoming ultraviolet and X-ray photons emitted from the disk surrounding the SMBH heat ionize the gas in the BLR.

        Also seen are radio jets relativistic in nature that are being emitted from close to the accretion disk and extending away to several kiloparsecs 
        (Hopkins et al., 2006, Urry, 2004). Active galaxies are classified into the following types depending upon their luminosity, emission-line properties, 
        and variability characteristics (Kewley et al., 2006).
        <br>
        <u><b> Central engine:</b></u>
        <br>
        Active galaxies are basically highly compact and luminous (L<sub>Bol</sub>  10<sup>42</sup> erg/s). The only way such high luminosity can be emitted from a compact source is due 
        to the object presence of a supermassive black hole with a high Eddington luminosity. The accretion of matter due to the high gravitational potential of the 
        SMBH gives rise to the emission of broadband continuum radiation from the central engine. The geometric size of a 10<sup>8</sup> M<sub>ʘ</sub> is  0.1 pc. The X-ray continuum 
        produced in the innermost regions close to the SMBH, due to the accretion, illuminates the accretion disk confined within a few milliparsec distances from 
        the center and gives rise to inverse – Compton scattering. As the X-ray radiation leaves the central engine, it interacts with the disk. Another evidence 
        that suggests that the central engine is a supermassive black hole is the correlation seen with the mass of the SMBH and the velocity dispersion of the 
        galactic bulge (Ferrarese and Merritt, 2000) or with the bulge luminosity (Marconi and Hunt, 2003).
