    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Continuum in Astronomy and Spectral Analysis</h1>

    <p>
        In astronomy, the term <strong>continuum</strong> refers to the smooth, broad-band component of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by an astronomical 
        object. It forms the <em>background spectrum</em> upon which discrete spectral features such as emission or absorption lines are superimposed. The continuum 
        is a crucial part of a galaxy or star’s spectrum and carries essential information about the object’s temperature, composition, and energy output.
    </p>
    <h2>What Is the Continuum?</h2>
    <p>
        The continuum is the continuous distribution of light intensity over a range of wavelengths or frequencies. Unlike spectral lines, which arise from transitions 
        between specific energy levels in atoms or molecules, the continuum originates from a variety of broader physical processes such as:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Blackbody radiation</strong> from stars or accretion disks</li>
            <li><strong>Synchrotron emission</strong> from relativistic particles in magnetic fields (e.g., in active galaxies)</li>
            <li><strong>Free-free emission</strong> (Bremsstrahlung) from hot ionized gas</li>
            <li><strong>Dust emission</strong> in the infrared from heated interstellar dust grains</li>
        </ul>
        The shape and strength of the continuum vary depending on the source's physical conditions and emission mechanisms.
    

    <h2>Importance of Continuum in Spectral Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        The continuum provides the baseline against which astronomers measure and analyze <strong>spectral lines</strong>. Accurate determination and subtraction of the continuum is essential for:
        <ul>
            <li>Calculating line intensities and equivalent widths</li>
            <li>Identifying weak spectral features</li>
            <li>Measuring redshifts and physical properties of galaxies and quasars</li>
            <li>Determining the underlying energy sources in active galactic nuclei (AGN)</li>
        </ul>
        For example, in AGNs, the continuum often originates from the accretion disk and jet processes, while in normal galaxies it may result from stellar populations.
   

    <h2>Sources of Continuum Emission</h2>
    <p>
        Depending on the type of astronomical object, different processes dominate the continuum:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stars:</strong> Emit blackbody-like continua, peaking in the visible or infrared depending on temperature</li>
            <li><strong>Galaxies:</strong> The integrated light from billions of stars forms the stellar continuum; dust and gas add extra components</li>
            <li><strong>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN):</strong> Show complex continua from accretion disks, jets (synchrotron), and hot coronae (X-rays)</li>
            <li><strong>Supernovae:</strong> Emit thermal continua from shock-heated plasma</li>
        </ul>
   

    <h2>Continuum Subtraction</h2>
    <p>
        In spectral analysis, particularly for studying emission or absorption lines, the continuum must be estimated and subtracted. This process is called <strong>continuum subtraction</strong>. Common techniques include:
        <ul>
            <li>Fitting a low-order polynomial to continuum regions (line-free intervals)</li>
            <li>Using spline interpolation through selected anchor points</li>
            <li>Modeling the stellar continuum using population synthesis templates</li>
        </ul>
        Once subtracted, the resulting spectrum highlights the line features more clearly, allowing precise measurement of line flux, width, and shape.
    

    <h2>Spectral Index and Continuum Slope</h2>
    <p>
        The shape of the continuum spectrum is often described using a <strong>spectral index (α)</strong> in the form of a power law:
        <br/>
        <code>F<sub>(ν)</sub> ∝ ν<sup>-α</sup></code>
        <br/>
        where F<sub>(ν)</sub> is the flux density at frequency ν. The value of α indicates whether the spectrum is rising or falling with frequency and helps distinguish 
        between thermal and non-thermal emission.
    </p>

    <h2>Continuum in Different Wavelengths</h2>
    <p>
        Continuum emission is observed across the electromagnetic spectrum:
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Radio:</strong> Dominated by synchrotron emission in AGNs and supernova remnants</li>
        <li><strong>Infrared:</strong> Thermal emission from dust grains</li>
        <li><strong>Optical/UV:</strong> Blackbody radiation from stars and accretion disks</li>
        <li><strong>X-ray:</strong> Non-thermal emission from high-energy environments like hot coronae or relativistic jets</li>
        </ul>
        The relative strength of the continuum in these bands gives insights into the physical processes at work.
